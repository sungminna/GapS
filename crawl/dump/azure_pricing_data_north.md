## Azure OpenAI Service pricing overview

Azure OpenAI Service delivers enterprise-ready generative AI featuring powerful models from OpenAI, enabling organizations to innovate with text, audio, and vision capabilities. Beyond the cutting-edge models, companies choose Azure OpenAI Service for built-in data privacy, regional/area/global flexibility, and seamless integration into the Azure ecosystem including Fabric, Cosmos DB and Azure AI Search. Companies of all sizes can confidently scale AI solutions to enhance customer experience, automate workflows, and unlock creative potential, driving measurable impact and competitive differentiation.  
  
To help customers in the journey, we offer pricing and cost management solutions to meet your needs. including: 

  * **Standard (On-Demand):** Pay-as-you-go for input and output tokens. 
  * **Provisioned (PTUs):** Allocate throughput with predictable costs, with monthly and annual reservations available to reduce overall spend. 
  * **Batch API:** Language models are also now available in the Batch API for global deployments and three regions, that returns completions within 24 hours for a 50% discount on Global Standard Pricing. 

You can choose from the following deployment types for Standard and Provisioned, which enable greater flexibility and control of pricing and performance. This flexibility helps when there is increasingly more restrictive data processing boundaries and need for increased throughput and lower price. 
  * **Global Deployment** – Global SKU 
  * **Data Zone Deployment** – Geographic based (EU or US)
  * **Regional Deployment** – Local Region (up to 27 regions)

Prices are estimates only and are not intended as actual price quotes. Actual pricing may vary depending on the type of agreement entered with Microsoft, date of purchase, and the currency exchange rate. Prices are calculated based on US dollars and converted using London closing spot rates that are captured in the two business days prior to the last business day of the previous month end. If the two business days prior to the end of the month fall on a bank holiday in major markets, the rate setting day is generally the day immediately preceding the two business days. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month. Sign in to the Azure pricing calculator to see pricing based on your current program/offer with Microsoft. Contact an Azure sales specialist for more information on pricing or to request a price quote. See frequently asked questions about Azure pricing.

## Assistants API

The Assistants API and its tools make it easy for developers to build AI Assistants in their applications.

The tokens used for the Assistants API are billed at the chosen language model's per token input/output rates used with each Assistant. Additionally, we charge the following fees for tool usage:

Tool | Input  
---|---  
File Search* | $0.10/GB of vector-storage per day (1 GB free)  
Code Interpreter** | $0.03/session  
  
*GB refers to binary gigabytes, where 1 gb is 2^30 bytes.

**If your assistant calls Code Interpreter simultaneously in two different threads, this would create two Code Interpreter sessions (2 * $0.03). Each session is active by default for one hour, which means that you would only pay this fee once if your user keeps giving instructions to Code Interpreter in the same thread for up to one hour.

Inference cost (input and output) varies based on the GPT model used with each Assistant. If your assistant calls Code Interpreter simultaneously in two different threads, this would create two Code Interpreter sessions (2 * $0.03). Each session is active by default for one hour, which means that the price is for up to one hour of giving instructions to Code Interpreter in the same thread.

## Frequently asked questions

Frequently asked questions about Azure pricing

  * How is Azure OpenAI Service priced? 

Azure OpenAI Service offers pricing based on both Pay-As-You-Go and Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs). Pay-As-You-Go allows you to pay for the resources you consume, making it flexible for variable workloads. PTUs offers a predictable pricing model where you reserve and deploy a specific amount of model processing capacity. This model is ideal for workloads with consistent or predictable usage patterns, providing stability and cost control.
